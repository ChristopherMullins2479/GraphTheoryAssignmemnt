    "#### The graph isomorphism problem involves determining if two finite graphs are isomorphic. The problem isn't known to be solved in polynomial time or to be NP-complete, hence it could fall into the NP-intermediate computational complexity category. The graph isomorphism problem is known to be in the low hierarchy of class NP, which means it isn't NP-complete until the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to the second level.[1]"
