# GraphTheoryAssignmemnt

## Introduction.
#### For the Graph Theory end of year assignment Summer 2021/2022 we were required to create a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook will be showing python implementation of graph theory and discussing Heap Sort and the Graph Isomorphism Problem. I will also like to show my understanding ofGraph Theory..

# What will you need?

## Jupyter Notebook
#### Jupyter installation requires Python 3.3 or greater. This will be ran from the cmd prompt by using the following command. jupyter notebook.
#### This will have to be can in the file diesctory.


# What is in the Notebook

## Heap Sort.
#### Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the minimum element at the beginning. We repeat the same process for the remaining elements. In many ways, heapsort is an improved selection sort: like selection sort, it separates its input into sorted and unsorted regions, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted regions by extracting their largest elements and inserting them into the sorted regions. In the notebook we will be exploring this concepy visualy using Python.

# Graph Isomorphism Problem.
#### The graph isomorphism problem involves determining if two finite graphs are isomorphic. The problem isn't known to be solved in polynomial time or to be NP-complete, hence it could fall into the NP-intermediate computational complexity category. The graph isomorphism problem is known to be in the low hierarchy of class NP, which means it isn't NP-complete until the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to the second level. This problem is a subset of the subgraph isomorphism problem, which asks whether a given graph G includes a subgraph that is isomorphic to another graph H and is known to be NP-complete. It's also known to be a specific example of the symmetric group's non-abelian hidden subgroup problem. In this notebook we will be discussing what makes graphs isometric and writing an algorithm to check if two graphs are isometric.
